# Why Am I Doing This?

_A repo for documenting minutia so you don't have to repeat it in your comments_.

## Usage

1. Write a document decribing some minutia that you might usually describe 
with a large comment block -- in several places across your code.

2. Replace said large comment block with a repo link:
  ```js
  /**
   * @see {@link <LINK_TO_REPO_DOC>}
   */
  ```
