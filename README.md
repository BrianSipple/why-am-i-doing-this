# Why Am I Doing This?

_A repo for documenting minutia so you don't have to repeat it in your comments_.

## Usage

Sometimes, code gets esoteric. And when it does, you might find yourself attempting to
document it for other developers. 

First of all, thank you. But second, there might be
a better way... 

1. Write a document describing some minutia that you might usually describe 
with a large comment block -- possibly in several places across your code.

2. Replace said large comment block with a repo link:
  ```js
  /**
   * @see {@link <LINK_TO_REPO_DOC>}
   */
  ```

## Contributing

Right now, I'm still not sure if everyone shouldn't just keep their own 
repo like this. In the meantime, though, feel free to send along a PR or 
make a suggestion!
